# Summary component output testing

Trying if it's working correctly

<Summary
  label={
    <span>
      The only way I found to pass formulas to the label is this — <MathInline>f</MathInline>.
    </span>
  }
>
There's some content with a simple formulas in it. But there's no way to put a
list in it. Tailwinds resets all the list styles to none. Let's try:

1.  Let's try to put here some block formula

$$
h = e([x^0, \ldots, x^n]; \mathbf{\theta}_e).
$$

2.  And inline one here — $h \in \mathbb{H}$
3.  Three
4.  And nothing

</Summary>
